A web browser displays information identified by a URL. 
    - And the first step is to use that URL to connect to and download that information from a server somewhere on the Internet.
To display a web page, the browser first needs to get a copy of it. 
1 - So, it asks the OS to put it in touch with a server somewhere on the internet; 
    1 - the first part of the web page’s URL (before the first /) tells it the server’s host name. 
    2 - The OS then talks to a DNS server which convertsOn some systems, you can run dig +short example.org to do this conversion yourself. 
    3 - a host name like example.org into a destination IP address like 93.184.216.34.
        Today there are two versions of IP: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv6 addresses are a lot longer and are usually in hex, but otherwise the differences don’t matter here. 
    4 - Then the OS decides which hardware is best for communicating with that destination IP address (say, wireless or wired) using what is called a routing table, 
    and then uses device drivers to send signals over a wire or over the air.I’m skipping steps here. 
        On wires you first have to wrap communications in ethernet frames, on wireless you have to do even more. I’m trying to be brief. 
        Those signals are picked up and transmitted by a series of routersOr a switch, or an access point, there are a lot of possibilities, 
        but eventually there is a router. which each choose the best direction to send your message so that it eventually gets to the destination.
        They may also record where the message came from so they can forward the reply back, especially in the case of NATs. 
    5 - When the message reaches the server, a connection is created. 
    Anyway, the point of this is that the browser tells the OS, “Hey, put me in touch with example.org”, and it does.

On many systems, you can set up this kind of connection using the telnet program, like this:The “80” is the port, discussed below.

telnet example.org 80

A URL looks like this:
